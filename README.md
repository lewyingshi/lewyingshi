  Hi, I am currently a student at Winona State University with a major in Data Science.
  <br> I love all things data viz and I'm an aspiring data analyst/graphics reporter.
  Check out my current/long-term project at my <a href = "https://lewyingshi.github.io/blog/"> blog </a> site where I attempt to visualize data and practice my ability to tell stories with data.

I am currently doing a lot of work with R and a little Tableau. I am also expanding my data science horizon with Python and other visualization tools out there that will produce efficient results for data storytelling.
