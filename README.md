  Hi, I am currently a senior at Winona State University with a major in Data Science.
  <br> I love all things data viz and I'm an aspiring data analyst/data viz developer/graphics reporter.
  Check out my current attempt of data storytelling at my <a href = "https://lewyingshi.github.io/blog/"> blog </a> site where I attempt to visualize, inform and improve with different datasets.

I am currently doing a lot of visualization projects with Tableau and a little in R + Python. I am also expanding my data science horizon with Python and other visualization tools out there that will produce efficient results for data storytelling, analysis, cleaning, etc.
